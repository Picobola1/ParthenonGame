# How it works?
Our game uses OpenCV for tracking and Pygames for the dinosaur gameplay.
All the logic is contained in the Combined.py file. Anyway, you can check all the previous versions files.

# Why we did it?
We did it to challenge ourselves; we started looking for projects that involved programs we had never used before and looked for a way to have fun while learning.

# What did we learn?
We not only learned to use new tools, we learned to work together using GitHub and some useful skills.
